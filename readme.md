## MP3 Renamer

So you've converted your music collection off of youtube sent it all through something like picard and the ID3 tags are all properly set, but alas the file names contain things like (official video), (some other bullshit youtubers like to add in).

Well now this tool solves all your problems, it sets the file names of all of your mp3's to {{artist}} - {{title}}.mp3.

### Usage

MP3Renamer.exe <path (optional)>

Notice: if you don't specify a path we'll assume you wan to run mp3renamer on the current directory.
